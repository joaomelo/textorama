# Textorama

Textorama is a web editor that works with plain text files in your local system.

The content is in your disk in a universal open format, and the browser ensures the editor only accesses the files you permit. There is no need for security measures like sign-in. Your data is inherently portable and organized the way you want.

You can start authoring by accessing the [app](https://textorama.melo.plus) and clicking **new** or **open** in the top bar.

# Main Shortcuts

By the way, all those top bar buttons are tied to keyboard shortcuts: new is _alt + n_, open with _ctrl + o_, and search through _ctrl + f_.

Depending on your browser support, you will see buttons save that go by _ctrl + s_ and save as with _ctrl + d_. Other users will see the download button, which also works with _ctrl + d_.

# Local Files

Suppose you are on a computer using Chrome, Edge, or Opera. In that case, you will have an experience similar to desktop apps with the ability to save to the same file continuously.

Better still, on those platforms, the browser lets you install Textorama on your local machine. After that, you can open files directly from your system file explorer.

If you are on a mobile device or using either Firefox or Safari, you can still save locally, but every operation translates to downloading a new text file.

# Text Editing

Many of Textorama's features come from the fantastic [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) library. Among them:

- A set of keyboard shortcuts found in [this list](https://codemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.defaultKeymap).
- Select and edit at multiple locations by holding CTRL and clicking the positions you want to add new cursors.
- Support for the markdown syntax. It is still portable plain text but visually enriched. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

Another nicety is the ability to resize the editor on large screens. You can do that by dragging the splits on both the editor corners. If you double-click any of them, they will maximize the editor width.

# Open Source

This project is open source. You are welcome to run, copy, distribute and study the software available at its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joaomelo/textorama).

Regarding contributions, I have a daytime job and a wonderful family to assist. So I code in the gaps presented late nights and weekends. To manage that scarcity and my mental health, I decided to keep the project closed to contributions for now.

Nevertheless, you can always open issues towards the project in the code repository, and my [personal site](http://joao.melo.plus) has my social profiles if you want to contact me.
