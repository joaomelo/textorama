Plain is an editor that works with plain text from files inside your file system.

The content is in your disk in a universal open format. There is no need for security measures like sign-in; it is inherently portable and organized the way you want.

The primary operations are in the top bar buttons, and the editor only accesses the files you permit.

The editor plays nicely with the markdown syntax. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
