Plain is a modest text editor. It works with plain text files in your file system.

The content is in your disk in a universal open format, and the browser ensures the editor only accesses the files you permit. There is no need for security measures like sign-in. Your data is inherently portable and organized the way you want.

The primary operations are in the top bar buttons. You can start authoring by clicking _new_ or _open_.

The editor plays nicely with the markdown syntax. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
