Plain is an editor that works with plain text from files inside your file system. The editor only accesses the files you permit.

The content is in your disk in a universal open format. There is no need for security measures like sign-in; it is inherently portable and organized the way you want.

The primary operations are in the top bar buttons. You can start authoring by clicking _new_ or _open_.

The editor plays nicely with the markdown syntax. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
