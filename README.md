Plain is an editor that works with plain text from files inside your file system. The editor only accesses the files you permit.

The content is inherently portable, everything organized the way you want, and there is no need for security measures like sign-in.

The commands are in the top bar buttons. You can start authoring by clicking _new_ or _open_.

The editor plays nicely with the markdown syntax. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
