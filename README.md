Textorama is a modest text editor. It works with plain text files in your file system.

The content is in your disk in a universal open format, and the browser ensures the editor only accesses the files you permit. There is no need for security measures like sign-in. Your data is inherently portable and organized the way you want.

The primary operations are in the top bar buttons. You can start authoring by clicking **new** or **open**.

Suppose you are on a computer using Chrome, Edge, and Opera. In that case, you will have an experience similar to desktop apps with the ability to save to the same file continuously.

If you are on a mobile device or using either Firefox or Safari, you can still save locally, but every operation translates to downloading a new text file.

The editor plays nicely with the markdown syntax. You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
