# Textorama

Textorama is a web editor that works with plain text files in your local system.

The content is in your disk in a universal open format, and the browser ensures the editor only accesses the files you permit. There is no need for security measures like sign-in. Your data is inherently portable and organized the way you want.

You can start authoring by accessing the [app](https://textorama.online/) and clicking **new** or **open** in the top bar.

# Local Files

Suppose you are on a computer using Chrome, Edge, and Opera. In that case, you will have an experience similar to desktop apps with the ability to save to the same file continuously.

Better still, on those platforms, the browser lets you install Textorama on your local machine. After that, you can open files directly from your system file explorer.

If you are on a mobile device or using either Firefox or Safari, you can still save locally, but every operation translates to downloading a new text file.

# Markdown

Textorama plays nicely with the markdown syntax. It is still portable plain text but visually enriched.

You can read more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

# Open Source

This project is open source. You are welcome to run, copy, distribute and study the software available at its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joaomelo/textorama).

Regarding contributions, I have a daytime job and a wonderful family to assist. So I give my love to coding in the gaps presented late nights and weekends. To manage that scarcity and my mental health, I decided to keep the project closed to contributions for now.
